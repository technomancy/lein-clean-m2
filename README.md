# lein-clean-m2

A Leiningen plugin to clean the local repository of unused artifacts.

This only takes the `:dependencies` and `:plugins` of a single project
into consideration; don't use this in a user account unless it's only
used for a single project.

## Usage

Add `[lein-clean-m2 "0.1.2"]` to `:plugins` in `project.clj`, then run

    $ lein clean-m2
